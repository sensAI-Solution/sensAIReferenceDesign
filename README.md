## Human Machine Interface Demo
The [CrossLinkU™-NX System-on-Module (SoM) HMI Demonstration Design](https://www.latticesemi.com/products/designsoftwareandip/intellectualproperty/demos/human-to-machine-interfacing-demonstration) is a demo solution for Human-Machine Interaction (HMI) applications. It enables AI-driven interaction capabilities such as person detection, face recognition, and face identification, delivering intuitive and intelligent user experiences at the edge.
This design is optimized for low-power embedded vision systems, leveraging Lattice’s FPGA technology and AI pipeline for real-time inferencing. It integrates with Raspberry Pi CM5 for visualization and control through a web-based dashboard.
